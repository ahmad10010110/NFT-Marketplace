# Solidity NFT Marketplace

Welcome to our Solidity NFT Marketplace repository! This repository contains the smart contract code for a decentralized marketplace where users can mint, list, buy, and auction NFTs. The marketplace operates entirely on the blockchain, with no front-end interface.

## Features

- **Mint NFT:** Users can mint their own NFTs, giving them unique digital ownership.
- **List NFT for Sale:** Sellers can list their NFTs for sale on the marketplace.
- **Buy NFT:** Buyers can purchase NFTs listed for sale using the marketplace's native token.
- **List NFT for English Auction:** Sellers can initiate English auctions for their NFTs, setting a starting price and duration.
- **Bid in English Auction:** Bidders can place bids on NFTs listed for English auction.
- **End English Auction:** The auction for an NFT automatically ends at the specified duration, and the highest bidder wins.
- **List NFT for Dutch Auction:** Sellers can initiate Dutch auctions for their NFTs, setting a starting price, reserve price, and duration.
- **Bid in Dutch Auction:** Bidders can place bids on NFTs listed for Dutch auction, with the price decreasing over time.
- **End Dutch Auction:** The auction for an NFT automatically ends at the specified duration or when the reserve price is met, and the highest bidder wins.

## Token Usage

Our marketplace has its own native token, which serves as the medium of exchange for trading NFTs. Users can buy, sell, and bid on NFTs using this token.

## Getting Started

2. **Mint NFTs:** Use the mint function to create new NFTs, giving them unique properties and ownership.
3. **List NFTs:** Utilize the list functions to offer NFTs for sale or auction, specifying the terms and conditions.
4. **Buy and Bid:** Purchase NFTs listed for sale or participate in auctions by placing bids.
5. **Enjoy Ownership:** Once acquired, you own the NFT and can transfer, trade, or auction it as desired.
